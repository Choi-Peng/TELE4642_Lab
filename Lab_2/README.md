# TELE4642 Network Performance - Lab 2   

In this lab, we will design and implement a Fat-Tree topology and its 
routing protocol using Mininet and Ryu. 

This assignment consists of two parts. In part a, you will implement a Fat-Tree topology using Mininet API. In part b, you will design an OpenFlow based application for Fat-Tree topology, and then implement the application using Ryu controller. The resulting network application runs on top of Ryu controller. 

- Part a

  [fat_tree.py](fat_tree.py) builds the fat-tree topology using Mininet.

- Part b

  [route.py](route.py) implement the routing rules using Ryu.
